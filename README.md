# 2020programming2Project

This project is for the class AP computer science.

## Idea:

It was hard for me to come up with something to do for this project, so I kind of just made a bunch of calculators/convertors in the form of GUI's. I also made a GUI music player.

## How to navigate this repository
All source code, pictures and videos of project running, and the sound file are in the src directory. Below are pictures and a video of the project running.

## Year 2 concepts in this project:
1. Recursion is used on the FibonacciFrame.java file in order to find the value of that number in the Fibonacci Sequence. 2. GUI controls like buttons and text fields are used throughout the whole project. 3. An interface is used to supply common methods to the different classes. 4. And the MusicFrame/ Music Player uses file i/o and exception handling.

## Design and Testing
I probably spent a total of 25 hours on this project. I spent most of my time on this project on the MusicFrame because it was kind of difficult to figure out how to get everything in it to work. I also had some difficulty figuring out what I wanted to do for this project. Initially, the idea was to be a game, but since graphics are pretty difficult to do in Java, I decided to go with something less difficult. I would randomly add things that came to my mind. The first idea was a weight converter, then a distance converter, then a BMI calculator. Then I wanted to do a music player, but I realized it wouldn't be easy to do that. Then after learning about recursion in school, I decided to make a Fibonacci calculator using a recursive method. After doing that, I tried to make the method into a ternary statement, but I coudln't figure out how to do it. But at least the Fibonacci calculator worked with a recursive method. Then I returned to working on the music player. It took me a long time to figure out how to get it to work because of the different exception handling errors I was getting. For my song, I used a cover of Confudatis Maledictis by Mozart that was made by one of my friends. After finishing all the coding for the project, I added comments to it, then created a new UML for it since the old one I was using was for my previous idea of a game.
## How to use
Click on the buttons, they will take you to different classes where you can enter an amount which will be converted to a different unit. The Music Player uses buttons and doesn't return anything, but you will hear a song after about 3 seconds after pressing the start button.
