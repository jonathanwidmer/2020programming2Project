## Idea:

It was hard for me to come up with something to do for this project, so I kind of just made a bunch of calculators/convertors in the form of GUI's. I also made a GUI music player.

## Design and Testing
I probably spent a total of 25 hours on this project. I spent most of my time on this project on the MusicFrame because it was kind of difficult to figure out how to get everything in it to work. I also had some difficulty figuring out what I wanted to do for this project. Initially, the idea was to be a game, but since graphics are pretty difficult to do in Java, I decided to go with something less difficult. I would randomly add things that came to my mind. The first idea was a weight converter, then a distance converter, then a BMI calculator. Then I wanted to do a music player, but I realized it wouldn't be easy to do that. Then after learning about recursion in school, I decided to make a Fibonacci calculator using a recursive method. After doing that, I tried to make the method into a ternary statement, but I coudln't figure out how to do it. But at least the Fibonacci calculator worked with a recursive method. Then I returned to working on the music player. It took me a long time to figure out how to get it to work because of the different exception handling errors I was getting. For my song, I used a cover of Confudatis Maledictis by Mozart that was made by one of my friends. After finishing all the coding for the project, I added comments to it, then created a new UML for it since the old one I was using was for my previous idea of a game.
